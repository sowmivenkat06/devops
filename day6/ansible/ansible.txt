📦 Ansible Automation Process

Ansible is an agentless automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration. It connects to target machines using SSH and executes tasks defined in Playbooks.

🧭 Step-by-Step Ansible Flow
1️⃣ Install Ansible (Control Node)

Install Ansible on the machine from which automation will be executed.

sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible -y


Verify installation:

ansible --version

2️⃣ Prepare Managed Nodes

Ensure:

SSH access is enabled.

Python is installed.

The control node can reach the hosts.

Test:

ssh user@target-ip

3️⃣ Create Inventory File

The inventory file contains IP addresses or hostnames of managed machines.

Example (/etc/ansible/hosts or custom file):

[web]
192.168.1.10

[db]
192.168.1.20

4️⃣ Test Connectivity (Ping)

Check if Ansible can communicate with nodes.

ansible all -m ping


Expected output → SUCCESS.

5️⃣ Write a Playbook

A playbook defines tasks to run on managed nodes using YAML format.

Example: install_nginx.yml

---
- name: Install Nginx
  hosts: web
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Install nginx package
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present

6️⃣ Run the Playbook

Execute automation tasks.

ansible-playbook install_nginx.yml

7️⃣ Verify Changes

Login to the target system and confirm service/package installation.

systemctl status nginx

🧠 What Happens Internally?

Ansible reads the inventory.

Connects via SSH.

Pushes modules to nodes.

Executes tasks.

Returns output.

Removes temporary files.

📁 Recommended Project Structure
ansible-project/
│── inventory
│── playbook.yml
│── roles/
│── group_vars/

🚀 Common Ad-Hoc Commands

Install package:

ansible web -m apt -a "name=git state=present" --become


Restart service:

ansible web -m service -a "name=nginx state=restarted" --become

🔐 Advantages of Ansible

✔ Agentless
✔ Uses SSH
✔ Simple YAML syntax
✔ Idempotent execution
✔ Easy scaling
