1) Install Jenkins (Ubuntu)
Step 1 – Update packages
sudo apt update

Step 2 – Install Java (required)
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre -y


Check:

java -version

Step 3 – Add Jenkins repository key
curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee \
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null

Step 4 – Add repository
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null

Step 5 – Install Jenkins
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jenkins -y

Step 6 – Start Jenkins
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl enable jenkins


Check status:

sudo systemctl status jenkins

Step 7 – Open Jenkins in browser
http://<server-ip>:8080


Example:

http://localhost:8080

Step 8 – Get Admin Password
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword


Copy → paste in browser.

Step 9 – Install Suggested Plugins

Click:

Install suggested plugins

✅ 2) Create User Account in Jenkins

After plugin installation:

Click:

Create First Admin User


Fill:

Username
Password
Confirm password
Full name
Email


Click:

Save and Continue


Jenkins dashboard opens.

Create Additional Users (later)

Manage Jenkins → Manage Users → Create User

CREATE NEW ITEM IN JENKINS (NAME: devops)
3) What is a Trigger in Jenkins?

A trigger tells Jenkins WHEN to run a job automatically.

Examples:

GitHub push

Every day at 9 AM

After another job finishes

Types of Build Triggers

Inside job → Build Triggers

Common options:

✔ Poll SCM
✔ Build periodically
✔ GitHub hook trigger
✔ Build after other projects

STEP 1: Open Jenkins

Open browser:

http://localhost:8080

Login with credentials.

STEP 2: Click New Item

From dashboard → New Item

STEP 3: Enter Name

Type:

devops

STEP 4: Select Type

Choose:

Freestyle Project

STEP 5: Click OK → Save

✅ Job created successfully.

  TRIGGER CREATION (UPSTREAM → DOWNSTREAM)
STEP 1: Create job1

New Item → job1 → Freestyle → OK → Save

STEP 2: Create job2

New Item → job2 → Freestyle → OK → Save

STEP 3: Configure job1 to trigger job2

Open job1 → Configure

Post-build Actions → Build other projects

Projects to build:

job2


Select:

Trigger only if build is stable


Save.

STEP 4: Add build steps (optional for demo)

job1:

echo "Running Job 1"


job2:

echo "Running Job 2"

STEP 5: Test

Build job1.

✔ job1 runs
✔ If success → job2 starts automatically

FLOW
job1 → job2

WHAT IS UPSTREAM & DOWNSTREAM ?
Term	Meaning
Upstream- Job	The job that runs first
Downstream- Job	Job triggered after upstream succeeds

Example:

job1 → job2


job1 = Upstream
job2 = Downstream

Used for multi-step CI/CD flows.

2) Jenkins Pipeline Process

Pipeline = automation using code.

Instead of clicking steps manually, we write them in a file.

CI/CD PIPELINE (GIT → JENKINS → DOCKER)
Pipeline Stages (Flow)
Fetch Code → Build → Test → Deploy

STEP 1: Push code to GitHub

Repo should contain:

Dockerfile
server.js / app.js
package.json


Commands:

git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/sowmivenat06/devops.git
git push -u origin main

STEP 2: Install Plugins

Manage Jenkins → Manage Plugins

Install:

Git Plugin

Docker Pipeline Plugin

Restart Jenkins.

STEP 3: Create Pipeline Job

New Item →
Name:

devops-pipeline


Select → Pipeline → OK

STEP 4: Pipeline Script
  pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {

        stage('Clone Repo') {
            steps {
                git branch: 'day3', url: 'https://github.com/sowmivenkat06/devops.git'
            }
        }

        stage('Install Dependencies') {
            steps {
                dir('day3/E-learning-devops') {
                    sh 'npm install'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Build Application') {
            steps {
                dir('day3/E-learning-devops') {
                    sh 'npm run build'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

STEP 5: Build

Click:

Build Now


Console shows:
✔ Clone
✔ Build
✔ Run container

STEP 6: Access Application
http://localhost:7000


or EC2:

http://<public-ip>:7000


Output example:

Hello Sowmiya – Jenkins and Docker deployment running successfully

How Pipeline Runs:

When triggered:

Jenkins reads Jenkinsfile

Executes stage by stage

Shows progress in Stage View

Success / Failure result displayed



WHAT IS JENKINS CORE ?

Jenkins Core is the main engine of Jenkins.

It provides:

Job scheduling

Build execution

Plugin support

UI & API

Node/agent handling

Without core → Jenkins cannot run.

Plugins extend Jenkins features.

✅ WHAT IS A .sh FILE ?

.sh = Shell Script

It contains Linux commands.

Example:

#!/bin/bash
echo "Build started"
docker build -t app .


Instead of writing commands inside Jenkins, we can call:

sh script.sh


Used for:
✔ automation
✔ reusability
✔ version control

✅ WHAT IS sudo chmod +x ?

Command:

sudo chmod +x script.sh


Meaning:

chmod → change permission

+x → make executable

After this, file can run like:

./script.sh


Without permission → permission denied error.

✅ WHAT ARE TRIGGERS IN JENKINS ?

Triggers tell Jenkins WHEN to run a job.

Types:

Manual (Build Now)

GitHub webhook (on push)

Poll SCM

Scheduled (cron time)

After another job

✅ CRONTAB GURU TIME FORMAT (USED IN PIPELINE)

Used for scheduled builds.

Example in Jenkins:

Build periodically


Example expression:

H/5 * * * *


Meaning:

Every 5 minutes


Format:

MIN HOUR DAY MONTH DAY-OF-WEEK


Examples:

Expression	Meaning
H/5 * * * *	every 5 mins
0 9 * * *	daily at 9 AM
0 0 * * 0	every Sunday

You can verify at:

crontab.guru

✅ GITHUB AUTO TRIGGER (WEBHOOK)

Pipeline → Configure → Build Triggers

Tick:

GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling


GitHub → Settings → Webhooks

Payload URL:

http://<server-ip>:8080/github-webhook/


Now every push → automatic build.
