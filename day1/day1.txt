# Linux, Windows, VM & Commands

## **Windows OS**

**Windows** is a *paid*, GUI-based operating system developed by Microsoft. It is mainly used for desktops and general applications. Command-line work is done through *Command Prompt* or *PowerShell*. Customization is limited compared to Linux.

## **Linux OS**

**Linux** is *free and open-source*. It is secure, stable, lightweight, and widely used in *servers, cloud, and DevOps*. Most operations are done through the *terminal*. Popular distributions include Ubuntu, CentOS, and Red Hat.

## **Windows vs Linux**

Windows is easier for everyday users. Linux offers *better security, automation,* and *flexibility*, making it ideal for servers and development work.

## **Virtual Machine (VM)**

A **VM** is a computer running inside another computer. It helps run multiple operating systems on the same hardware. Example: running Ubuntu inside Windows using VMware.

*Host OS* = main system.
*Guest OS* = OS inside the VM.

**NAT** shares host internet, while **Bridged** gives a separate IP.

## **WSL**

**Windows Subsystem for Linux** lets you run Linux commands in Windows *without a full VM*. It is faster and lightweight but provides less isolation.

---

## **VMware**

**VMware Workstation** is used to create virtual machines. After installation, you can load an OS ISO like Ubuntu and practice Linux safely.

---

## **Ubuntu Installation (Basic Flow)**

Create VM → attach ISO → select disk → create username/password → install → reboot → update using:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

## **Important Linux Commands**

`pwd` shows location. `ls` lists files. `cd` changes directory.
`mkdir` creates folders. `touch` creates files.
`cp` copies, `mv` moves, `rm` deletes.

`cat` and `less` read files.
`grep` searches text.
`chmod` changes permissions.

Use `top` to view processes, `ip a` for IP address.

---

## **Package Management**

Use APT to manage software.
*update* refreshes list, *upgrade* installs latest versions, and *install* adds new packages.

---

## **vi Editor**

Press *i* to type, *Esc* to stop, `:w` to save, `:q` to quit, `:wq` to save and exit.

---

## **LTS**

*Long Term Support* versions receive updates for many years and are recommended for servers.

---

## **rm -rf**

Used to *force delete* files and folders recursively. Be very careful.
